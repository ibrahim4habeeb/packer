To configure outbound internet access for a VM on an Azure private network and ensure that it has access to GitHub servers using Azure Firewall and Network Security Groups (NSGs), follow these steps:

### Step 1: Create and Configure Azure Firewall

1. **Create Azure Firewall**:
    - Navigate to the Azure Portal.
    - Go to "Create a resource" and search for "Firewall".
    - Click "Create" and fill in the required details (e.g., resource group, name, region).
    - Create a new virtual network or select an existing one.
    - Click "Review + create" and then "Create".

2. **Configure Firewall Rules**:
    - Go to the Azure Firewall you created.
    - Navigate to "Rules" and add a new application rule collection.

    Example Application Rule to allow traffic to GitHub:
    - **Name**: AllowGitHub
    - **Priority**: 100
    - **Action**: Allow
    - **Rule**:
        - **Name**: AllowGitHub
        - **Source Type**: IP Address
        - **Source**: (IP address of your VM or subnet range)
        - **Protocol**: HTTP, HTTPS
        - **Target FQDNs**: `github.com`, `api.github.com`

3. **Associate Firewall with Subnet**:
    - Ensure the firewall is in a subnet within your virtual network.
    - This subnet should be dedicated to Azure Firewall.

### Step 2: Route Traffic Through Azure Firewall

1. **Create a Route Table**:
    - Navigate to "Create a resource" and search for "Route Table".
    - Click "Create" and fill in the required details (e.g., name, region).
    - Click "Review + create" and then "Create".

2. **Add a Route to the Route Table**:
    - Go to the route table you created.
    - Click on "Routes" and then "Add".
    - Fill in the route details:
        - **Route name**: ToAzureFirewall
        - **Address prefix**: 0.0.0.0/0
        - **Next hop type**: Virtual appliance
        - **Next hop address**: (IP address of your Azure Firewall)

3. **Associate Route Table with Subnet**:
    - Go to the route table.
    - Click on "Subnets" and then "Associate".
    - Select the virtual network and subnet where your VM resides.

### Step 3: Configure Network Security Groups (NSGs)

1. **Create an NSG**:
    - Navigate to the Azure Portal.
    - Go to "Create a resource" and search for "Network Security Group".
    - Click "Create" and fill in the required details.
    - Click "Review + create" and then "Create".

2. **Configure NSG Rules**:
    - Go to the NSG you created.
    - Add outbound security rules to allow traffic to GitHub.

    Example NSG rule:
    - **Name**: AllowGitHubOutbound
    - **Priority**: 100
    - **Direction**: Outbound
    - **Source**: Any
    - **Source port ranges**: *
    - **Destination**: Service Tag
    - **Service Tag**: Internet
    - **Destination port ranges**: 443 (HTTPS)
    - **Protocol**: TCP
    - **Action**: Allow

3. **Associate NSG with Subnet or Network Interface**:
    - Go to the NSG.
    - Click on "Subnets" and associate it with the subnet where your VM resides.
    - Alternatively, you can associate it with the network interface of the VM directly.

### Verification and Testing

1. **Verify Internet Connectivity**:
    - SSH into your VM.
    - Use `curl` or `ping` to test connectivity to GitHub:
    ```bash
    curl -I https://github.com
    ```

2. **Check Firewall Logs**:
    - If using Azure Firewall, check the firewall logs to ensure traffic is being routed correctly.

3. **Monitor Network Traffic**:
    - Use Azure Network Watcher to monitor and diagnose network issues if connectivity fails.

By following these steps, your Azure VM should have the necessary outbound internet access via Azure Firewall and NSGs configured to allow communication with GitHub server
