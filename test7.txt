I want to stop and start this VM using shell script using az cli and I want to test the condition if the VM is stop it should validate to start and if it is start running it show validate to stop the vm

You can use the Azure CLI (az) to manage your Azure VM, including starting and stopping it. Below is a shell script that will check the current state of the VM and either start it if it's stopped or stop it if it's running.

bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash

# Variables
RESOURCE_GROUP="your-resource-group"
VM_NAME="your-vm-name"

# Get the status of the VM
VM_STATUS=$(az vm get-instance-view --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $VM_NAME --query "instanceView.statuses[1].code" -o tsv)

# Check if VM is running or stopped
if [[ $VM_STATUS == "PowerState/running" ]]; then
    echo "VM is running. Stopping the VM..."
    az vm stop --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $VM_NAME
    echo "VM stopped."
elif [[ $VM_STATUS == "PowerState/deallocated" ]]; then
    echo "VM is stopped. Starting the VM..."
    az vm start --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $VM_NAME
    echo "VM started."
else
    echo "VM is in an unknown state: $VM_STATUS"
fi
Replace your-resource-group and your-vm-name with the appropriate values for your Azure VM.

Steps to Use the Script:
Save the script to a file, e.g., manage-vm.sh.
Make the script executable: chmod +x manage-vm.sh.
Run the script: ./manage-vm.sh.
Explanation:
The script retrieves the VM's current status using the az vm get-instance-view command.
It checks the VM's status:
If the VM is running (PowerState/running), it stops the VM using the az vm stop command.
If the VM is stopped (PowerState/deallocated), it starts the VM using the az vm start command.
If the VM is in any other state, it prints the unknown state.
Ensure you have the Azure CLI installed and configured with the necessary permissions to manage the VM.
