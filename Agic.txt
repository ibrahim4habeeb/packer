Use pls application Gateway agic ingress service yamls to create private AKS
With one best example including mc_rg ?
To set up an Azure Private AKS cluster using Private Link Service (PLS) with Azure Application Gateway Ingress Controller (AGIC), you will need to create the necessary YAML files for the AGIC service. Below is an example of the YAML configuration to deploy AGIC as an ingress controller in a private AKS cluster and integrate it with the Application Gateway using PLS.This example assumes you have already set up your AKS cluster with an appropriate Application Gateway, subnet, and necessary permissions. The following steps outline how to set up AGIC:1. Resource Group and Cluster SetupEnsure you have a resource group and AKS cluster set up. The resource group is often named something like MC_<cluster_name>_<location>. For this example, let's assume:Resource Group: MC_rgAKS Cluster: myPrivateAKSClusterLocation: eastus2. Create a Managed Identity for AGICAGIC requires a managed identity that has permissions to access the Application Gateway. Set up the identity using Azure CLI:# Create a managed identity for AGIC
az identity create --resource-group MC_rg --name agicIdentity

# Get the identity client ID and resource ID
IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID=$(az identity show -g MC_rg -n agicIdentity --query clientId -o tsv)
IDENTITY_RESOURCE_ID=$(az identity show -g MC_rg -n agicIdentity --query id -o tsv)3. Assign Permissions to the Managed IdentityAssign the Contributor role to the managed identity for the Application Gateway:# Assign Contributor role to the managed identity for the Application Gateway
APPGW_RESOURCE_ID=$(az network application-gateway show --resource-group MC_rg --name <your-application-gateway-name> --query id -o tsv)

az role assignment create \
  --assignee $IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID \
  --scope $APPGW_RESOURCE_ID \

terraform apply -auto-approveDeploy the Ingress and Service YAML files in your AKS cluster:kubectl apply -f ingress-service.yamlSummaryThe Terraform script creates a private AKS cluster with the AGIC add-on enabled, allowing it to use the Application Gateway for ingress traffic.The YAML configuration sets up an ingress rule for routing traffic to a backend service via AGIC.This configuration provides a secure, private AKS cluster with ingress managed by Azure Application Gateway.

When we add-on agic as plug-in to private aks creation time then at that time only it will automatically create application Gateway right  then you are you creating application Gateway explicitly is it mandatory?
Could you please clarify me ?
When you enable the Application Gateway Ingress Controller (AGIC) add-on during the creation of a private AKS cluster using Terraform or Azure CLI, you have two options regarding the Application Gateway:Bring Your Own Application Gateway (BYOAG): You create the Application Gateway explicitly before creating the AKS cluster. In this approach, you specify the Application Gateway's ID during the cluster creation process. This method allows you to fully control the Application Gateway's configuration, such as defining its size, rules, and subnets.Automatic Application Gateway Creation (Managed AGIC): Azure automatically creates an Application Gateway for you when you enable the AGIC add-on and don’t specify an existing Application Gateway. Azure manages this gateway, and it’s automatically associated with your AKS cluster. However, this automatically created Application Gateway has limited customization options, and Azure manages its configuration.Why Create the Application Gateway Explicitly?Creating the Application Gateway explicitly (BYOAG) provides more control over the setup, including:Customization: You can customize the Application Gateway's configuration, such as setting specific rules, backend pools, and HTTP settings.Networking Control: You can place the Application Gateway in a specific subnet, control IP addresses, and manage its integration with other resources in your network.Security and Compliance: You can ensure the gateway meets specific security standards, such as using custom SSL certificates or adhering to organizational compliance policies.Scaling and Performance: You can define the size, scaling parameters, and SKU (e.g., Standard_v2 or WAF_v2) based on your application's needs.Automatic Application Gateway Creation:If you rely on the automatically created Application Gateway (Managed AGIC), it simplifies the setup process but with limited options:Less Control: Azure handles the configuration, and you cannot make many modifications to the Application Gateway settings after creation.Easier Setup: Suitable for basic use cases where deep customization is not required.Key Takeaway:It is not mandatory to create the Application Gateway explicitly if you enable the AGIC add-on during AKS creation. However, doing so allows you to have control over the gateway's configuration, which might be necessary for more complex or production environments.If customization is not required, you can let Azure automatically create the Application Gateway when you enable the AGIC add-on by omitting the gateway_id parameter in the Terraform configuration:# AKS Cluster with AGIC add-on without explicit Application Gateway creation
resource "azurerm_kubernetes_cluster" "aks" {
  name                = var.aks_name
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.aks_rg.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.aks_rg.name
  dns_prefix          = "myaks"

  default_node_pool {
    name       = "agentpool"
    node_count = var.node_count
    vm_size    = var.node_size
    vnet_subnet_id = azurerm_subnet.subnet.id
  }

  identity {
    type = "SystemAssigned"
  }

  addon_profile {
    ingress_application_gateway {
      enabled = true
      # Do not set gateway_id to let Azure create the Application Gateway automatically
    }
  }

  network_profile {
    network_plugin    = "azure"
    load_balancer_sku = "standard"
  }

  api_server_authorized_ip_ranges = ["<your-ip-address>/32"] # Replace with your IP for access
  private_cluster_enabled = true
}Conclusion:Automatic Creation: Simplifies setup, but you have limited control over the Application Gateway.Explicit Creation (BYOAG): Offers full control, customization, and specific security configurations needed for enterprise-grade environments.Choose the approach that best fits your needs based on the level of control and customization required for your Application Gateway.

Why private dns zone and  private dns zone virtual network link is created above ?
The creation of a Private DNS Zone and linking it to the Virtual Network in the Terraform script is part of setting up a fully private AKS cluster. Here’s why it’s included and how it plays a crucial role:Purpose of Private DNS Zone and Virtual Network Link:Private Cluster Connectivity: A private AKS cluster restricts access to its API server endpoint so that it is only accessible from within the Virtual Network (VNet). This requires private DNS resolution to ensure that resources within the VNet can properly resolve the private IP addresses of the API server.DNS Resolution for Private Endpoints: Private DNS Zones help resolve private link service domains that are used internally by Azure services, including AKS. In this case, the Private DNS Zone is used to resolve the private FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name) of the AKS cluster's API server.VNet Linking: The Virtual Network Link (azurerm_private_dns_zone_virtual_network_link) connects the Private DNS Zone to the Virtual Network. This link allows the VNet to resolve DNS queries against the Private DNS Zone, enabling private IP communication between the AKS cluster and other services within the VNet.Key Reasons for Including These Resources:AKS Private Endpoint Resolution: The AKS private endpoint created during the deployment needs to be resolved correctly within the VNet. The Private DNS Zone provides the necessary DNS records for this.Enabling Private Access to the API Server: For a private AKS cluster, the API server is not exposed publicly, so you need a private DNS configuration to enable communication from your local network or other Azure resources over private IP addresses.Simplifying Internal Networking: The linked DNS zone makes it easy for other resources in the VNet (e.g., Bastion Hosts, Jump Servers) to communicate with the AKS cluster without requiring manual DNS management.When Is It Needed?Private AKS Clusters Only: This setup is essential when deploying private AKS clusters, where all communication is confined within Azure’s private network space and does not rely on the public internet.Secure Environments: Useful in scenarios that require restricted access for security reasons, such as production environments where exposing the API server to the internet is not permissible.If Not Needed:If your private AKS cluster setup already handles DNS resolution through existing infrastructure (e.g., custom DNS servers or existing private DNS zones), you can omit these steps. However, typically in most private AKS setups, having these DNS components configured ensures a seamless and secure deployment.Conclusion:Including the Private DNS Zone and linking it to your VNet ensures that private AKS clusters can communicate effectively within the Azure environment, resolving internal endpoints without exposing them publicly. This setup is a best practice for private, secure networking within Azure.

Is there any other alternate method to do the same ?
Yes, there are alternate methods to handle private DNS resolution for private AKS clusters without explicitly creating a Private DNS Zone and linking it to the Virtual Network. Here are some common approaches:1. Azure-Managed Private DNS Zone (Automatic Method)Azure automatically manages private DNS zones for private endpoints, including AKS clusters, when you enable Private Cluster mode. This managed configuration doesn’t require you to explicitly create and link DNS zones in your Terraform or ARM template. Here's how it works:Automatic DNS Resolution: When you create a private AKS cluster, Azure automatically configures a managed private DNS zone (privatelink.<region>.azmk8s.io) that handles the internal resolution of the cluster’s API server without requiring manual DNS setup.No Manual Management Needed: The private DNS zone and required DNS records are automatically managed by Azure, reducing the complexity of the setup.Configuration: Simply ensure your cluster is deployed in private mode; Azure takes care of DNS without additional Terraform resources:resource "azurerm_kubernetes_cluster" "aks" {
  name                = var.aks_name
  location            = var.location
  resource_group_name = var.resource_group_name

  # Enable private cluster
  private_cluster_enabled = true 

  # Azure manages DNS automatically; no need to create or link DNS zones manually.
}2. Use Custom DNS Servers in VNetIf you have existing custom DNS infrastructure (e.g., corporate DNS servers) integrated with your Azure environment, you can configure your VNet to use those DNS servers. This method avoids using Azure Private DNS Zones entirely:Custom DNS Setup: Configure your VNet’s DNS settings to point to your internal or custom DNS servers that handle private endpoint resolution.DNS Forwarding Rules: Set up DNS forwarding rules on your custom DNS servers to forward requests to Azure’s managed DNS zones or to resolve AKS private endpoint domains correctly.Configuration: Configure the VNet’s DNS settings to use custom DNS servers in the Terraform setup:resource "azurerm_virtual_network" "vnet" {
  name                = var.vnet_name
  resource_group_name = var.resource_group_name
  location            = var.location
  address_space       = ["10.0.0.0/16"]

  # Use custom DNS server IPs
  dns_servers = ["<custom-dns-server-ip>"]
}3. Azure Private Link Service (Custom Integration)Use Azure Private Link Service with DNS integration to connect resources securely to your AKS cluster. You set up private endpoints manually with the correct DNS settings on your custom DNS infrastructure.Summary of Alternatives:Azure-Managed Private DNS Zone (Automatic): Azure automatically manages DNS for private AKS clusters without needing explicit configuration.Custom DNS Servers in VNet: Use your own DNS servers for handling private endpoint resolution by configuring DNS servers at the VNet level.Private Link Service with Custom DNS: For advanced, controlled scenarios, integrate Private Link Service with your DNS strategy.Key Advantage: These methods reduce manual configuration and offer flexibility, especially when you have existing DNS management solutions integrated with your network environment.


After creating this 
Here’s how to create a private AKS cluster using the AGIC add-on with managed Application Gateway directly using Terraform. This setup allows Azure to handle the Application Gateway creation, reducing the complexity of your setup while still leveraging the Application Gateway for ingress traffic management.

Could you tell me the list of all resources created newly with in the given subscription inside Azure Portal?
When you create a private AKS cluster with the AGIC add-on using managed Application Gateway directly through Terraform, several resources are automatically provisioned within your Azure subscription. Here's a list of the main resources that are created:1. Resource GroupName: As specified in the Terraform configuration (e.g., MC_rg)Purpose: Holds all the resources related to the AKS cluster and associated components.2. Virtual NetworkName: Defined in Terraform (e.g., myVNet)Purpose: Provides networking for the AKS cluster, Application Gateway, and other related components.3. SubnetName: Defined in Terraform (e.g., mySubnet)Purpose: Hosts the AKS nodes and potentially other resources, such as the Application Gateway.4. AKS Cluster (Azure Kubernetes Service)Name: Defined in the Terraform configuration (e.g., myPrivateAKSCluster)Purpose: The core Kubernetes service where your workloads are deployed.5. Managed Application GatewayName: Automatically created and managed by Azure as part of the AGIC add-on.Purpose: Handles ingress traffic for applications deployed in the AKS cluster.Note: The name may not be directly configurable, as it is managed by Azure.6. Managed AGIC Add-onPurpose: Integrated within the AKS cluster to automatically manage traffic routing through the Application Gateway.7. Private DNS Zone (Optional)Name: Automatically created and managed by Azure (e.g., privatelink.<region>.azmk8s.io).Purpose: Resolves private IP addresses for the private AKS cluster API server.8. Node Resource GroupName: Automatically generated (usually prefixed with MC_ followed by the resource group and cluster names).Purpose: Contains all AKS-managed resources, such as load balancers, managed disks, NICs, and the managed Application Gateway.9. Load BalancerName: Automatically managed within the AKS node resource group.Purpose: Handles networking between the Application Gateway and the AKS cluster nodes.10. Network Security Groups (NSGs)Name: Managed within the VNet or node resource group.Purpose: Controls traffic to and from the AKS nodes and Application Gateway.11. Route Tables (Optional)Purpose: May be created if required by the private cluster networking configuration.12. Log Analytics Workspace (Optional)Name: If monitoring is enabled, Azure creates or associates the AKS cluster with a Log Analytics workspace.Purpose: Collects logs and metrics from the AKS cluster.Summary of Newly Created Resources:AKS Cluster: Main compute resource.Managed Application Gateway: Ingress traffic controller.Virtual Network and Subnet: Network infrastructure.Private DNS Zone (managed): For private endpoint resolution.Node Resource Group: Contains cluster-associated resources.Load Balancer: For internal and external traffic routing.NSGs and Route Tables: For securing and routing network traffic.These resources will be visible in the Azure portal under the specified resource groups, typically split between the main resource group (MC_rg) and the automatically generated node resource group.

Could you tell me this main points of difference between private aks which is created here and without private aks for the same .
And what are the difference main point to observe on the Azure Portal resource creation between both list it ?
Creating a private AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service) cluster versus a public AKS cluster has significant differences in terms of security, accessibility, and resources created in the Azure portal. Here’s a breakdown of the main differences between a private AKS cluster (as described in the Terraform configuration above) and a standard public AKS cluster, along with the key differences you will observe in the Azure portal.Main Differences Between Private AKS and Public AKS Clusters:AspectPrivate AKS ClusterPublic AKS ClusterAPI Server AccessibilityOnly accessible within the VNet through private IP addresses. No internet exposure.Accessible via a public IP address over the internet.SecurityHigher security due to restricted access; ideal for production environments.Lower security compared to private; open to public access.NetworkingRequires private DNS configuration and careful subnet planning.Simpler networking setup, typically using public endpoints.Ingress and Egress TrafficTraffic is controlled strictly via private endpoints and VNet settings.Uses public load balancers for ingress traffic unless otherwise configured.Private EndpointA private endpoint is created for the API server, enhancing security.No private endpoint is created for API server access.Managed Private DNS ZoneAutomatically created to resolve private cluster API server addresses.Not used; the public DNS handles API server resolution.Required ResourcesMore complex due to DNS zones, private endpoints, and potential VNet integration.Fewer additional resources; mainly uses public DNS and networking.Azure RBAC and PoliciesEasier to enforce strict RBAC and security policies within a closed network.RBAC and policies are applied but less effective if the API server is publicly accessible.Key Observations in the Azure Portal:When you compare the resources created for private and public AKS clusters in the Azure portal, you will notice the following key differences:API Server Endpoint:Private AKS: No public IP is visible for the API server; access is through the private endpoint within the VNet.Public AKS: The API server has a public-facing IP address, visible in the cluster's networking settings.Private DNS Zone:Private AKS: Azure automatically creates a managed Private DNS Zone (privatelink.<region>.azmk8s.io), used for resolving private API server addresses.Public AKS: No Private DNS Zone is created or required; standard public DNS resolution is used.Node Resource Group:Private AKS: Contains private endpoints, private load balancers, and potentially more complex NSG (Network Security Group) configurations.Public AKS: Contains public load balancers and standard networking components without private endpoints.Load Balancer Type:Private AKS: Internal load balancers are used for cluster traffic; external access points are restricted.Public AKS: Public load balancers are used, which can expose services to the internet.Virtual Network Integration:Private AKS: Requires careful subnet planning with private endpoints integrated within the VNet. You will also see VNet links to the private DNS zone.Public AKS: Less complex VNet integration; typically, only the cluster nodes are within the VNet, while the API server remains accessible publicly.Ingress and Egress Configuration:Private AKS: Uses internal-only ingress controllers (e.g., Application Gateway Ingress Controller with private IP) that do not expose services externally unless explicitly configured.Public AKS: Ingress controllers are typically configured with public IPs unless manually set to internal mode.Networking Components:Private AKS: Observes additional resources like private endpoints, private DNS zone links, and sometimes custom route tables in the portal.Public AKS: Standard networking components like public load balancers and default DNS settings are visible.Summary of Differences:Private AKS Clusters are more secure, restrict access to private IPs, and require additional resources like private DNS zones and internal endpoints.Public AKS Clusters are simpler, easier to access, and have fewer security layers, with a public API server endpoint visible directly in the Azure portal.Understanding these differences helps in selecting the appropriate AKS cluster type based on security requirements and network complexity.


Ingress and Egress TrafficTraffic is controlled strictly via private endpoints and VNet settings.Private EndpointA private endpoint is created for the API server, enhancing security.

How to achieve this via ple and pls to access app1 runner inside node pod for external world user using annotations and ple pls etc ?
To expose an application running inside a private AKS cluster to the external world using Private Link Service (PLS) and Private Link Endpoint (PLE), you need to configure the Application Gateway Ingress Controller (AGIC) with proper annotations and network setup. Here's a detailed guide on how to achieve this setup using PLS, PLE, and specific annotations.Overview:Private Link Service (PLS): Acts as a frontend interface to expose services running in the AKS cluster to external users securely.Private Link Endpoint (PLE): Provides a private IP address within your VNet that connects to the PLS, allowing secure access to the application.Steps to Set Up PLS and PLE for App Exposure:1. Create the Private Link Service (PLS) in AKS:This step involves configuring a service of type LoadBalancer in the AKS cluster with annotations that enable PLS.Service YAML Example with PLS:apiVersion: v1

  annotations:
    # Annotation to enable Private Link Service (PLS)
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-pls-enabled: "true"
    # Specify the IP address type for the PLS
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-pls-ip-configuration-subnet: "<subnet-name>"
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  selector:
    app: app1
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80802. Create a Private Link Endpoint (PLE) in the Client’s VNet:This step involves creating a PLE that connects to the PLS created by the AKS cluster. This allows clients within the VNet to access the service privately.Terraform Example for PLE Creation:resource "azurerm_private_endpoint" "example" {
  name                = "app1-private-endpoint"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  subnet_id           = azurerm_subnet.example.id

  private_service_connection {
    name                           = "app1-connection"
    private_connection_resource_id = azurerm_kubernetes_cluster.app1.id # PLS resource ID
    is_manual_connection           = false
  }
}3. Configure Application Gateway Ingress Controller (AGIC):To manage the ingress traffic, ensure AGIC is configured properly in the private AKS cluster with the right annotations.Ingress YAML Example:apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: app1-ingress
  namespace: default
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: azure/application-gateway
    appgw.ingress.kubernetes.io/use-private-ip: "true"  # Ensures internal traffic routing
spec:
  rules:
    - host: app1.example.com
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: app1-service
                port:
                  number: 804. Networking Setup:Ensure that your PLS is properly configured with inbound and outbound rules to allow traffic from the PLE. This involves setting up Network Security Groups (NSGs) and route tables if needed.NSG Rules: Allow traffic from the PLE subnet to the PLS subnet and vice versa.Route Tables: Ensure proper routing between the PLE and PLS subnets, especially if they are across different VNets.5. Domain Name Configuration:Ensure that DNS resolution is set up correctly for the external world to access your app. You might need to update the DNS settings to point to the private IP of the PLE.Key Annotations and Points to Note:AGIC Annotations: appgw.ingress.kubernetes.io/use-private-ip: "true" ensures traffic is routed internally through private IPs.PLS Annotations: service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-pls-enabled: "true" activates the PLS on the service.PLE to PLS Binding: Make sure the PLE is correctly linked to the PLS service resource created in AKS for seamless traffic flow.Summary:This setup ensures that:The application (app1) inside the AKS cluster is exposed to the external world securely using PLS and PLE.AGIC manages ingress traffic, ensuring that all communication remains private and secure within Azure's private networking.Proper annotations ensure that the services behave as intended, routing traffic securely without exposing public IPs directly.This architecture maximizes security and provides controlled access to internal applications hosted on private AKS clusters, aligning with best practices for production environments.

Ingress and Egress TrafficTraffic is controlled strictly via private endpoints and VNet settings.Private EndpointA private endpoint is created for the API server, enhancing security.
annotations kubernetes. Io / ingress.class is deprecated? Right correct me if I am wrong ? If yes please give the latest annotations 
How to achieve this via ple and pls to access app500 app501 app502 ...app530 almost 30 apps are  runner inside node pod for external world user using annotations and ple pls etc ?
Yes, you are correct! The annotation kubernetes.io/ingress.class has been deprecated in favor of using the IngressClass resource or the spec.ingressClassName field directly within the Ingress manifest. For modern Kubernetes environments, it is recommended to use the IngressClass resource to define which controller should handle the ingress.To expose multiple applications (e.g., app500 to app530) inside a private AKS cluster to the external world using Private Link Service (PLS) and Private Link Endpoint (PLE), the setup will involve the following steps:Create a Private Link Service (PLS) in the AKS cluster to handle traffic securely.Create a Private Link Endpoint (PLE) in the client’s VNet to access the services exposed by the PLS.Configure Ingress Controllers using Application Gateway Ingress Controller (AGIC) with the latest annotations.Updated Ingress Configuration with AGIC and PLS/PLE SetupStep-by-Step Guide:1. Set Up the Private Link Service (PLS) in the AKS Cluster:Use the following configuration to set up services that expose your applications using PLS. This allows external users to connect through PLE.Example Service Configuration for PLS:apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: app-service
  namespace: default
  annotations:
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-pls-enabled: "true"  # Enable PLS on the service
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-pls-ip-configuration-subnet: "<subnet-name>"  # Specify subnet name for PLS
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  selector:
    app: app500  # Change this selector to match each app's labels
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80802. Create Private Link Endpoint (PLE) in Client's VNet:Create a PLE to connect the external VNet to your PLS, allowing secure access to the services. Below is a Terraform example to create PLE:resource "azurerm_private_endpoint" "example" {
  name                = "ple-to-aks"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  subnet_id           = azurerm_subnet.example.id

  private_service_connection {
    name                           = "app-ple-connection"
    private_connection_resource_id = azurerm_kubernetes_cluster.app1.id  # Resource ID of PLS
    is_manual_connection           = false
  }
}3. Configure AGIC Ingress with Latest Annotations:The latest approach uses IngressClass or spec.ingressClassName. Below is an example of an Ingress manifest that handles traffic using AGIC with proper private access setup.Ingress YAML for AGIC with Modern Annotations:apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: app-ingress
  namespace: default
  annotations:
    appgw.ingress.kubernetes.io/use-private-ip: "true"   # Ensures internal routing
    appgw.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-redirect: "true"     # Forcing SSL if needed
spec:
  ingressClassName: azure/application-gateway            # Define the IngressClassName directly
  rules:
    - host: app500.example.com
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: app-service  # This should correspond to each app's service
                port:
                  number: 804. Scale for Multiple Applications (app500 to app530):To handle multiple applications (app500 to app530), you can create a similar configuration for each application. Use a loop or automation scripts to generate the YAML files for services and ingress objects for each app.Key Annotations and Changes:spec.ingressClassName: Replaces the deprecated kubernetes.io/ingress.class annotation, specifying directly which ingress controller should handle the traffic.appgw.ingress.kubernetes.io/use-private-ip: "true": Ensures the ingress controller uses private IPs, critical for private networking scenarios.Summary of Steps for PLS and PLE with AGIC:Create PLS for Services: Exposes the application services securely within your VNet.Create PLE for External Access: Connects your external network securely to the PLS in the AKS cluster.Use IngressClassName for AGIC: Specifies AGIC to handle ingress traffic securely via private IP.Deploy Services for Each App: Repeat the process for each application (app500 to app530), ensuring private and secure access.This setup provides a robust, scalable, and secure method to expose multiple applications within a private AKS cluster, maintaining strong security boundaries with PLS and PLE.
