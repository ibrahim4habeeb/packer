I am using data "azurerm_subscription" "primary" with resource "azurerm_role_assignment" but the scope is force replacement 
Is the any alternate method to implement the same with out force replacement ?

Using the azurerm_subscription data source along with the azurerm_role_assignment resource can indeed result in force replacement because changes to the subscription level role assignments often require recreation of the resources. However, there might be alternative approaches depending on your use case and requirements.

Here are a few alternatives you might consider:

Limit Scope: Instead of assigning roles at the subscription level, consider assigning roles at a more granular level such as resource group, resource, or even specific Azure services. This approach reduces the need for force replacement because changes are localized to specific resources rather than affecting the entire subscription.

Azure Policy: Use Azure Policy to enforce role assignments across your subscription. Azure Policy allows you to define rules and enforce them across your Azure environment. While this doesn't directly replace the use of Terraform for role assignments, it can complement Terraform's infrastructure provisioning capabilities and provide a way to enforce policies without causing force replacements.

Custom Scripting: You could write custom scripts using Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, or Azure SDKs to manage role assignments outside of Terraform. While this approach gives you more control over the process, it also adds complexity and requires additional maintenance.

Conditional Logic: Depending on your specific requirements, you might be able to use conditional logic within your Terraform configuration to mitigate the impact of force replacement. For example, you could use the count parameter or for_each meta-argument to conditionally create or update resources based on certain conditions.

Terraform State Management: Ensure proper management of Terraform state to minimize the impact of force replacements. This includes using remote state storage, versioning Terraform state, and implementing state locking to prevent concurrent modifications.

Consider these alternatives based on your specific requirements, existing infrastructure, and organizational policies. Each approach has its own trade-offs in terms of complexity, manageability, and alignment with best practices.

what is the use of data "azurerm_key_vault"  ? what happend if we not use data "azurerm_key_vault" ?
What is the impact if we not use data "azurerm_key_vault" ? Is there is any other alternaive method to implement the same ?

The azurerm_key_vault data source in Terraform is used to retrieve information about an existing Azure Key Vault. This can be useful in various scenarios, such as when you need to reference secrets or keys stored in a Key Vault within your Terraform configuration.

If you don't use the azurerm_key_vault data source, it means you won't be able to directly access information about the existing Key Vault within your Terraform configuration. This might lead to difficulties in managing secrets or keys stored in the Key Vault or integrating them into your infrastructure provisioning process.

The impact of not using the azurerm_key_vault data source depends on your specific use case. If your infrastructure doesn't rely on Azure Key Vault for storing secrets or keys, then not using it might not have a significant impact. However, if you do use Azure Key Vault and need to manage it as part of your infrastructure provisioning, not using the data source could lead to manual intervention or additional complexity in managing secrets and keys.

As for alternative methods, if you're not using Terraform or Azure Key Vault, you might be using other infrastructure provisioning tools or storing secrets and keys in different ways. In Azure, you could potentially manage secrets and keys using Azure Key Vault directly through other means such as the Azure Portal, Azure CLI, or Azure PowerShell. However, if you're already using Terraform and Azure Key Vault, the azurerm_key_vault data source is the most direct and convenient way to integrate Key Vault into your Terraform configuration.
