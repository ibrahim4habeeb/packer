...app530 almost 30 apps are  runner inside node pod for external world user using annotations and ple pls etc ?
I want to use port as 443.
And 
How many maximum ple pls can be used to external world to access my 30 apps as discussed is there any limits and conditions to create ?
Yes, the annotation kubernetes.io/ingress.class has been deprecated. The recommended approach now is to use the IngressClass resource to define the ingress controller.Using PLE and PLS to Expose Multiple Applications with AGIC:To achieve access to multiple applications (app500, app501, ..., app530) running in your private AKS cluster using Private Link Service (PLS) and Private Link Endpoint (PLE), follow these steps:1. Create Private Link Service (PLS) for Each Application:Set up a Service of type LoadBalancer for each application and enable PLS with annotations.Example Service Configuration for PLS with Port 443:apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: app500-service
  namespace: default
  annotations:
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-pls-enabled: "true"
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-pls-ip-configuration-subnet: "<subnet-name>"
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  selector:
    app: app500
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 443
      targetPort: 8080Repeat this configuration for each application (app500, app501, etc.), adjusting the name, selector, and port values accordingly.2. Create Private Link Endpoint (PLE) in Client’s VNet:Create PLEs to connect the external world to your PLS. This allows users to access the services via private IPs.Example Terraform Configuration for PLE:resource "azurerm_private_endpoint" "example" {
  count               = 30  # Adjust based on the number of apps
  name                = "app${count.index}-ple"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  subnet_id           = azurerm_subnet.example.id

  private_service_connection {
    name                           = "app${count.index}-connection"
    private_connection_resource_id = azurerm_kubernetes_cluster.example.id  # PLS resource ID
    is_manual_connection           = false
  }
}3. Configure AGIC with Modern Annotations:Example Ingress Configuration for AGIC:apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: app500-ingress
  namespace: default
  annotations:
    appgw.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-redirect: "true"  # Redirect HTTP to HTTPS
    appgw.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol: "HTTPS"  # Use HTTPS for communication
spec:
  ingressClassName: azure/application-gateway
  rules:
    - host: app500.example.com
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: app500-service
                port:
                  number: 443Repeat this for each app, changing the host, name, and port values as needed.4. Considerations for Maximum Number of PLE and PLS:Limits and Conditions:Private Link Service (PLS): Typically, there is no hard limit on the number of PLS you can create, but practical limits are imposed by Azure subscription quotas and service plan capacities.Private Link Endpoint (PLE): You can have multiple PLEs, but there are quotas for the number of private endpoints per subscription. You should check Azure documentation or portal for current limits as these can vary.Regional Constraints: The number of private endpoints and services may be constrained by regional limits and the resources of your subscription.Scaling Considerations: Ensure you have adequate subnet capacity and that your network security groups (NSGs) and route tables are properly configured to handle the traffic.Summary:Set Up PLS: Configure services with PLS annotations and set port to 443.Create PLE: Set up private endpoints for secure access to each service.Use AGIC with Latest Annotations: Configure ingress with modern annotations and the IngressClass resource.Monitor Limits: Keep track of Azure limits and quotas for PLE and PLS resources in your subscription.By following these steps, you can securely expose multiple applications in your private AKS cluster to external users using PLE and PLS, while managing ingress traffic efficiently with AGIC.

What is the max and min Considerations for Maximum Number of PLE and PLS 
What is max and min practical limit imposed by Azure subscription quotas and service plan ?
Regional and scaling conditions?
List out all the details related to this ?
Maximum and Minimum Considerations for Private Link Endpoints (PLE) and Private Link Services (PLS)Azure provides certain limits and quotas for Private Link Endpoints (PLE) and Private Link Services (PLS). These limits are subject to change, so it's important to check the Azure documentation or Azure portal for the most current information.1. Private Link Endpoints (PLE)Maximum Limits:Per Subscription: Typically, there is a default limit of 2000 Private Endpoints per subscription. This can vary based on the Azure region and your subscription type.Per Resource Group: There is a default limit of 2000 Private Endpoints per resource group.Per VNet: Each VNet can have up to 500 Private Endpoints by default. This can be increased upon request through Azure support.Minimum Limits:No explicit minimum limit; you can create as few PLEs as needed, depending on your use case.Scaling Conditions:Regional Limits: Limits can be different based on the Azure region. Ensure you verify limits in the specific region where you plan to deploy your resources.Quota Requests: For higher limits, you need to request a quota increase from Azure support.2. Private Link Services (PLS)Maximum Limits:Per Subscription: The default limit is typically around 50 Private Link Services per subscription. This can be increased upon request through Azure support.Per VNet: There isn't a strict limit on the number of PLS per VNet, but you should consider the overall network capacity and design.Minimum Limits:No explicit minimum limit; you can create as few PLS as needed based on your design requirements.Scaling Conditions:Regional Limits: As with PLEs, the limits can vary by region. Verify the limits in your specific region.Quota Requests: If you need more PLS than the default limit, you may request an increase through Azure support.Considerations for Regional and Scaling Conditions:Network Design:Subnet Capacity: Ensure that your subnets have enough IP address space to accommodate the number of Private Endpoints and Services.VNet Peering: If using multiple VNets, consider how VNet peering and network security groups (NSGs) are configured.Performance Impact:Latency and Throughput: Consider the performance impact of using multiple Private Endpoints, as network traffic may be routed through private IPs within the VNet.Service Quotas: Ensure that the services you are connecting via Private Link can handle the expected throughput and traffic.Regional Availability:Service Availability: Check that Private Link services and endpoints are available in your chosen region.Resource Limits: Different regions may have different quotas and limits. Always verify these limits in the Azure portal or documentation.Security and Compliance:Network Security Groups (NSGs): Properly configure NSGs to control traffic flow to and from Private Endpoints.Access Controls: Ensure that appropriate access controls are in place for both PLS and PLE to prevent unauthorized access.Scaling and Quota Management:Monitor Usage: Regularly monitor your usage of Private Link resources to ensure you are within the limits.Request Increases: If you reach the default limits, request quota increases through Azure support.Summary:Private Link Endpoints (PLE): Typically up to 2000 per subscription/resource group and 500 per VNet, with regional variations and possible quota increases.Private Link Services (PLS): Typically up to 50 per subscription, with considerations for subnet capacity and regional limits.Scaling: Check regional availability and quotas, monitor performance impact, and request increases as needed.Always refer to the latest Azure documentation or the Azure portal for the most accurate and up-to-date limits and conditions.


How about if we use ilb the max pls limit is 8 .
Is it true ?
Yes, it is true. When using an Internal Load Balancer (ILB) with Private Link Service (PLS), there are additional limitations on the number of Private Link Services you can configure.Internal Load Balancer (ILB) with Private Link Service (PLS) Limitations:Maximum Number of Private Link Services (PLS) per Internal Load Balancer:Azure limits the number of Private Link Services (PLS) that can be associated with a single Internal Load Balancer (ILB) to 8.This limit is due to the way Azure manages routing and network traffic for ILB. Since ILBs operate within a virtual network and are used to provide private, internal load balancing, there is a practical limit to how many PLS can be directly associated with an ILB.Considerations:Scaling Beyond Limits:Multiple ILBs: If you need more than 8 Private Link Services, you will need to deploy multiple Internal Load Balancers and distribute the PLS across them.Design Alternatives: Consider using Azure Application Gateway with WAF or an Azure Front Door for scenarios where you need to scale beyond the ILB limits.Alternative Approaches:Application Gateway: For external traffic management, Application Gateway (AGIC) can be used with Azure Private Link to manage and scale ingress traffic.Azure Front Door: For global or high-availability scenarios, Azure Front Door can provide external access and global load balancing.Review Documentation:Always check the latest Azure documentation for the most current limits and recommendations, as Azure service limits can change.By understanding these limits and planning your architecture accordingly, you can design a scalable and efficient solution for your network traffic management needs.

H9w about with agic if we are using agic with pls is there limit to 8 like ilb and ple what could be the limit for this .
Could you please explaine the limits intnhsi case and what isnthebdifference between two.....??????
When using Application Gateway Ingress Controller (AGIC) with Private Link Service (PLS), the limits and considerations differ from those associated with Internal Load Balancer (ILB). Here’s a detailed breakdown:Limits with AGIC and Private Link Service (PLS):Application Gateway Ingress Controller (AGIC) with PLS:Number of PLS per AGIC: There is no explicit documented limit of 8 Private Link Services (PLS) per Application Gateway when using AGIC. AGIC can handle multiple backends, and the practical limits will depend on the configuration and performance considerations of the Application Gateway itself.Service Limitations: The actual limitations are more related to the Application Gateway's own configuration limits and the Azure subscription limits, rather than a hard cap on the number of PLS.Internal Load Balancer (ILB) with PLS:Number of PLS per ILB: As you noted, there is a practical limit of 8 Private Link Services (PLS) per Internal Load Balancer. This limit is due to the way ILBs are designed to handle internal network traffic and manage routing.Differences Between Using ILB and AGIC with PLS:Functionality:ILB:Internal Load Balancer (ILB) is used for balancing internal traffic within a Virtual Network (VNet).PLS with ILB allows you to expose services over a private IP within a VNet.Limit: There is a hard limit of 8 PLS per ILB due to internal traffic management constraints.AGIC:Application Gateway Ingress Controller (AGIC) manages external and internal traffic by routing it through Azure Application Gateway.PLS with AGIC allows you to expose services securely via private endpoints, with additional capabilities like WAF, SSL termination, and URL-based routing.Limit: There is no specific limit of 8 PLS per AGIC, but the overall number of services and traffic management capabilities will depend on the Application Gateway SKU and configuration.Traffic Management:ILB: Handles internal traffic within a VNet and is generally used for scenarios where services do not need to be exposed outside the VNet.AGIC: Manages both internal and external traffic and provides advanced features like SSL offloading, URL routing, and Web Application Firewall (WAF).Use Cases:ILB: Suitable for internal applications or services that only need to be accessed within a VNet. Examples include backend services, databases, and internal APIs.AGIC: Suitable for scenarios where you need to manage ingress traffic to applications with external access requirements, such as web applications, APIs, or services exposed via a public IP or custom domain.Summary:Internal Load Balancer (ILB): Limited to 8 Private Link Services (PLS) due to internal traffic management constraints.Application Gateway Ingress Controller (AGIC): No explicit limit of 8 PLS; practical limits depend on Application Gateway configuration and performance considerations.Choosing between ILB and AGIC with PLS depends on your use case and traffic management requirements. For internal services with limited exposure, ILB may suffice. For more complex scenarios requiring advanced traffic management and external access, AGIC with PLS is the preferred choice.
