Step 1: Configure the Application Gateway with PLSEnsure the Application Gateway managed by AGIC is correctly associated with the PLS (pls-500-01). This step assumes you have already set up AGIC and configured PLS as described in previous sections.

Do not do any assums 
Assume that we have nothing and I want to create this complete requirements from the scratch?

To achieve your requirements from scratch, where you need to configure a private AKS cluster with the AGIC add-on, and explicitly associate an Application Gateway with a Private Link Service (PLS), we'll set up the complete infrastructure step-by-step using Azure and Kubernetes resources. Here's a detailed guide to set everything up, starting from creating the necessary Azure resources to setting up the Ingress for your applications.Complete Setup: Creating Private AKS with AGIC and PLSStep 1: Create Resource Group, Virtual Network, and SubnetsThese foundational components are needed to host the AKS cluster, Application Gateway, and other related resources.# Create a Resource Group
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "rg-example"
  location = "East US"
}

# Create a Virtual Network
resource "azurerm_virtual_network" "example" {
  name                = "vnet-example"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  address_space       = ["10.0.0.0/16"]
}

# Create Subnets
# Subnet for AKS Nodes
resource "azurerm_subnet" "aks_subnet" {
  name                 = "aks-subnet"
  resource_group_name  = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  virtual_network_name = azurerm_virtual_network.example.name
  address_prefixes     = ["10.0.1.0/24"]
}

# Subnet for Application Gateway
resource "azurerm_subnet" "appgw_subnet" {
  name                 = "appgw-subnet"
  resource_group_name  = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  virtual_network_name = azurerm_virtual_network.example.name
  address_prefixes     = ["10.0.2.0/24"]
}

# Subnet for Private Link Service
resource "azurerm_subnet" "pls_subnet" {
  name                 = "pls-subnet"
  resource_group_name  = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  virtual_network_name = azurerm_virtual_network.example.name
  address_prefixes     = ["10.0.3.0/24"]
}Step 2: Create the Private AKS Cluster with AGIC Add-onThis step sets up the private AKS cluster and automatically configures AGIC, which will manage the Application Gateway for you.# Create the Private AKS Cluster with AGIC
resource "azurerm_kubernetes_cluster" "example" {
  name                = "aks-cluster"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  dns_prefix          = "aks-example"

  default_node_pool {
    name       = "default"
    node_count = 2
    vm_size    = "Standard_DS2_v2"
    vnet_subnet_id = azurerm_subnet.aks_subnet.id
  }

  identity {
    type = "SystemAssigned"
  }

  network_profile {
    network_plugin    = "azure"
    load_balancer_sku = "standard"
  }

  addon_profile {
    ingress_application_gateway {
      enabled    = true
      subnet_id  = azurerm_subnet.appgw_subnet.id
    }
  }

  api_server_access_profile {
    enable_private_cluster = true
  }
}Step 3: Retrieve the Managed Application Gateway DetailsAfter creating the AKS cluster, retrieve the Application Gateway details that are managed by the AGIC add-on. This will be used to set up the Private Link Service.# Data source to retrieve Application Gateway details
data "azurerm_application_gateway" "agic_gateway" {
  name                = "example-appgw"  # Replace with actual name after deployment
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
}Step 4: Create the Private Link Service (PLS) for the Application GatewayNow, explicitly create a PLS that connects to the Application Gateway. This will expose the Application Gateway to external users via private IPs securely.# Create a Private Link Service for the Application Gateway
resource "azurerm_private_link_service" "pls" {
  name                = "pls-500-01"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  load_balancer_frontend_ip_configuration_ids = [
    data.azurerm_application_gateway.agic_gateway.frontend_ip_configuration[0].id
  ]
  subnet_id = azurerm_subnet.pls_subnet.id

  # Configure access controls
  auto_approval {
    subscription_id = "<YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_ID>"  # Replace with your subscription ID
  }

  visibility {
    subscription_ids = ["<YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_ID>"]  # Replace with your subscription ID
  }

  # Set up private endpoint connections
  private_endpoint_connection {
    name       = "example-pe-connection"
    private_ip = "10.2.34.2"  # IP from PLS subnet
  }
}Step 5: Configure DNS for Private Link Service AccessCreate a Private DNS Zone: Set up a Private DNS Zone that matches the desired DNS prefix (dev-app500.dtt).Link the DNS Zone to Virtual Network: Associate the DNS Zone with the virtual network so it can resolve PLS-related IP addresses.# Create a Private DNS Zone
resource "azurerm_private_dns_zone" "example" {
  name                = "dev-app500.dtt"
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
}

# Link DNS Zone to Virtual Network
resource "azurerm_private_dns_zone_virtual_network_link" "example" {
  name                  = "dns-link"
  resource_group_name   = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  private_dns_zone_name = azurerm_private_dns_zone.example.name
  virtual_network_id    = azurerm_virtual_network.example.id
}Step 6: Configure Ingress Resource in AKSDeploy the Ingress resource in AKS that will use the AGIC to route traffic from the Application Gateway to your application pods.Ingress YAML Example for app500:apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: app500-ingress
  namespace: default
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: azure/application-gateway
    appgw.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-path-prefix: "/"
    appgw.ingress.kubernetes.io/use-private-link: "true"
    appgw.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol: "HTTPS"
    appgw.ingress.kubernetes.io/hostname: dev-app500.dtt
    appgw.ingress.kubernetes.io/request-timeout: "30"
spec:
  rules:
    - host: dev-app500.dtt
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: app500-service
                port:
                  number: 443Step 7: Testing and VerificationDeploy the Ingress Resource: Use kubectl apply -f app500-ingress.yaml to deploy the Ingress configuration to the AKS cluster.DNS Resolution: Test that dev-app500.dtt resolves to the IP address of the PLS (10.2.34.2).Access the Application: Access https://dev-app500.dtt externally and verify that it routes correctly through the PLS, Application Gateway, and AGIC to reach the application pods in AKS.Scaling for Multiple ApplicationsReuse the PLS and Application Gateway: You can use the same PLS and Application Gateway setup for other applications (app501, app502, ..., app530) by configuring additional Ingress resources with the appropriate DNS prefixes and backend services.DNS Configuration: Ensure each application has a corresponding A record and Ingress configuration to manage traffic.This setup provides a secure, scalable way to expose multiple applications running in a private AKS cluster using AGIC and explicitly configured PLS.

How about service yaml not seen here is it mandatory if required could you provide me the same ?
Yes, a Kubernetes Service YAML is mandatory to expose your application pods within the AKS cluster, which then gets referenced by the Ingress resource. The Ingress routes the traffic from the Application Gateway (via PLS) to the backend service, so having a Service object is crucial. Here's an example of a Kubernetes Service YAML file to work with your Ingress configuration:Service YAML Example for app500This Service definition will expose your application pods internally within the AKS cluster, and the Ingress resource will then use this Service to route external traffic to the pods.apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: app500-service
  namespace: default
  labels:
    app: app500
spec:
  type: ClusterIP  # Internal service, as it's being used by the Ingress
  ports:
    - port: 443                 # The port exposed by the Service
      targetPort: 8080          # The port on which the application container listens
      protocol: TCP
  selector:
    app: app500                 # Ensure this matches the labels on your podsKey Components of the Service YAMLtype: ClusterIP: The Service type is set to ClusterIP, which means it is only accessible within the cluster. This is typical when you are using an Ingress Controller to manage external access.ports:port: The port number that the Ingress will use to connect to this Service (e.g., 443 for HTTPS).targetPort: The port on which your application inside the pod is listening (e.g., 8080).selector: The labels under selector should match the labels of the application pods that this Service is targeting. This association allows the Service to route traffic to the correct pods.Complete Flow for Traffic Access Using AGIC, PLS, and IngressApplication Gateway (managed by AGIC) receives external traffic via PLS.Ingress Resource: The Ingress controller (AGIC) routes this traffic based on rules defined in the Ingress YAML, using the service name (app500-service) to locate the target pods.Service: Routes traffic to the appropriate application pods (app500) within the AKS cluster.Deployment StepsDeploy the Service YAML:kubectl apply -f app500-service.yamlDeploy the Ingress YAML:kubectl apply -f app500-ingress.yamlVerify the Service and Ingress:Check that the Service is up and correctly routing to the pods.Verify that the Ingress is correctly routing traffic from the Application Gateway to the Service.This Service definition is critical for connecting the external traffic from the Ingress to your internal application pods in the AKS cluster.

Is ilb required which is created by private aks by default I mean kubernetes-lb ?
What is its use in our setup which we have done now ?
In a private AKS setup, the Internal Load Balancer (ILB), often seen as kubernetes-internal-lb, is created by default. Here's an explanation of its role and whether it's required in your current setup involving AGIC, PLS, and Ingress.Role of the Internal Load Balancer (ILB) in a Private AKS SetupDefault Creation: When you create a private AKS cluster, an internal load balancer (kubernetes-internal-lb) is automatically provisioned. It is used to expose internal services within the cluster, such as the Kubernetes API server, to allow for internal communication without exposing those services to the public internet.Usage in Your Setup:In your current setup with AGIC, Application Gateway, and PLS, the ILB is not directly involved in routing traffic from external sources to your applications.The traffic flow is managed by AGIC, which directly uses the Application Gateway for ingress routing.The ILB’s primary role is to handle internal cluster services like control plane communication and private endpoint access, but it does not impact the external traffic routing that you’ve configured through AGIC.ILB vs. AGIC Routing:ILB: Mainly handles internal communication between the nodes and services within the AKS cluster. It is not used for external access in this setup.AGIC: Handles the ingress traffic from the Application Gateway and directs it to your Kubernetes Services and pods as per the Ingress rules.Impact on Your Setup:The ILB provides no direct routing of external traffic to the applications; it is unrelated to the PLS setup and Application Gateway ingress management.It does not interfere with the traffic flows managed by the AGIC setup; hence, no adjustments are needed for the ILB regarding external access.Is the ILB Required?Yes, for Internal Cluster Operations: The ILB is crucial for the internal communication of AKS components, especially in a private cluster setup where external exposure is restricted. It handles private endpoint communication to ensure secure internal access.No Direct Impact on AGIC and PLS Configuration: The ILB does not participate in the ingress traffic flow for your external-facing applications. The AGIC manages that through the Application Gateway.Summary of the ILB's Role in Your SetupThe ILB supports internal service communication within the AKS cluster.It does not manage or impact ingress traffic to your applications, which is fully handled by the AGIC and Application Gateway through PLS.No changes or specific configurations are needed for the ILB in your setup, as it operates independently of the external routing managed by AGIC.Let me know if you need more details or specific configurations related to ILB or the overall setup!
